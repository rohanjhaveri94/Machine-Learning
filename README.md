This course is taken by Dr. Asa-Ben Hur at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. In this course we learnt supervisied Machine learning algorithmas such as Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Perceptron, Adatron, Nueral Network etc.

This course consists for 5 Assignments and One Final Project.

• Assignment 1 is based on basic mathematical concepts of machine learning.

• Assignment 2 is an introduction to perceptron and adatron algorithms.

• Assignment 3 deals with implementation of Ridge Regression.

• Assignment 4 deals with Support Vector Machines.

• Assignment 5 is an introduction to Neural Networks.

Final assesment of this course was based on the project which was done in Collaboration with Mr. Ameya Kirve. The project was based on comparison of various classification algorithms viz. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Non-Linear Logistic Regression, Linear Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Networks which were implemented on various datasets and calculated their performance.
